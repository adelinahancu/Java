# Java
For this java project i was given a text file with a list of recipes and the lists of ingredients for each recipes,
quantity, measure unit and count of calories per each ingredients.
I created Ingredient and Recipe classes, used composition 
and encapsulation concepts. Read the text file and extracted the necessary information 
in order to create the attributes for each object(ingredient and recipe).
I created validation methods for the recipe objects, for example name validation,
cooking time validation, created a method for counting the number of calories for each recipe, a method for getting the most popular ingredient using a HashMap
I used regex for the name validation, used comparator interface to order the recipes by the cooking time and list of ingredients.
